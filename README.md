# gmail_bot_selenium
Creates a gmail account using selenium


I have written a code that can make a google account automatically and it requires a 6-digit one time password/verification code received on mobile phone to complete the process so I have used Pyaudio module , it will take my audio input and convert the speech to text using Speech Recognition module.


I have used official selenium docs and tech with tim youtube videos and some stack overflow code.
